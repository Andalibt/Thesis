\chapter*{Abstract}
The existence of a neutron Electric Dipole Moment~(nEDM) confirms the
theoretical models of Physics beyond the Standard Model which provide
extra sources of CP violation. Based on Sakharov Criteria, CP
violation is the main ingredient of the baryon asymmetry in the
universe. The current upper limit of the neutron EDM found to
be~$3.0 \times 10^{-26}$~e$\cdot$cm which is below the theoretical
models predictions. As a result, there is a worldwide quest to find if
nEDM nonzero. The typical experimental method to measure the nEDM uses
the Ultracold Neutrons~(UCN) and employs Ramsey method of separated
oscillatory fields. In this method, the Larmor precession frequency of
UCN is measured in the presence of diffent Electric and Magnic fields
orientations. Such precision measurements require high UCN statistics
and very stable and homogeneous magnetic fields.

This thesis focuses on these two aspects of the future nEDM
measurement at TRIUMF. The sensitivity goal of TUCAN's collaboration
is to measure the nEDM to the sensitivity level of $10^{-27}$. To meet
the magnetic stability requirement of $<~1$~pT, magnetic shields with
high magnetic permeability~($\mu$) such as MuMetal will be used to
nullify the external sources of magnetic fields. However, ambient
temperature fluctuations give rise to a change in the magnetic
permeability. Finite Element simulations were performed to correlate
such changes to the changes in the magnetic fields measured internal
to the shields. The experiments on the temperature dependence of
magnetic permeability as well as the result of those simulations are
presented to set a limit on the temperature control level for the
future nEDM effort at TRIUMF.

The TUCAN collaboration's goal is to design a next-generation UCN
source to increase the UCN statistics and reach the required nEDM
sensivity. In 2016, the vertical UCN source that was previously
developed at RCNP was shipped to TRIUMF and in 2017 the first UCN experiments
were conducted. The status of the current UCN facility at
TRIUMF and the result of the first UCN production tests are presented.
