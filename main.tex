\chapter*{Abstract}
The existence of a non-zero neutron electric dipole moment~(nEDM)
confirms the theoretical models of Physics beyond the Standard Model
which provide extra sources of CP violation. Based on Sakharov
Criteria, $CP$ violation is one of the main ingredients to create the
baryon asymmetry in the universe. The current upper limit of the
neutron EDM was found to be~$3.0 \times 10^{-26}$~e$\cdot$cm, which is
below the theoretical models predictions. As a result, there is a
worldwide quest to find a finite nEDM.

The typical experimental method to measure the nEDM uses the ultracold
neutrons~(UCN) and employs the Ramsey method of separated oscillatory
fields. In this method, the Larmor precession frequency of UCN is
measured in the presence of aligned Electric and Magnetic fields
orientations. Such precision measurements require high UCN statistics
and very stable and homogeneous magnetic fields.  The work presented
in this thesis is focused on the magnetic field and UCN studies for
the future nEDM measurement at TRIUMF.

The TUCAN's~(TRIUMF UltraCold Advanced Neutron source) collaboration
goal is to measure the nEDM to the sensitivity level of
$10^{-27}$. For this measurement, the~$<1$~pT magnetic stability
requirement could be met by using magnetic shields with high magnetic
permeability~($\mu$) to reduce the external magnetic fields. However,
external sources such as ambient temperature fluctuations could give
rise to a change in the magnetic properties such as $\mu$. The result
of the temperature dependence of $\mu$ measurements and related
simulations are presented here.
%The Finite Element simulations were performed to
%correlate such changes to the changes in the magnetic fields measured
%internal to the shields.
These measurements set a limit on the temperature control level for
the future nEDM measurement at TRIUMF.

The TUCAN collaboration's goal is to design a next-generation UCN
source to increase the UCN statistics and reach the required nEDM
sensitivity. In 2016, the vertical UCN source that was previously
developed at RCNP was shipped to TRIUMF. In early 2017, we
significantly improved the control system for data acquisition. In
November 2017, the first UCN experiments were conducted with the
source. The status of the current UCN facility at TRIUMF and the
result of the first UCN production tests are presented here.
