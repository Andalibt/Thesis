                  structure factor S(Q, omega ) of liquid 4 He in the
                  collective excitation regime. The use of the IN6
                  time-of-flight spectrometer at the Institut
                  Laue-Langevin has enabled us to cover the wavevector
                  region from 0.3 to 2.1 AA -1 in a continuous manner
                  with an accurately calibrated energy scale and an
                  energy resolution of approximately 0.1 meV;
                  temperatures between 1.24 and 4.95 K were examined
                  at saturated vapour pressure. In the wavevector
                  region investigated, sharp excitations are seen that
                  are unique to superfluid 4 He; it is the purpose of
                  the present paper to examine their temperature
                  dependence and to discuss measurements of the
                  multiphonon continuum scattering at higher
                  energies. At small wavevectors in the 'phonon'
                  region, the excitations are relatively unaffected by
                  the lambda transition, whereas at larger Q a sharp
                  component disappears at or close to T lambda . The
                  temperature variation of S(Q, omega ) is much more
                  rapid in the superfluid phase than in the normal
                  phase. In paper II of this series, the results for
                  S(Q, omega ) will be compared with several models
                  for the temperature variation of the 4 He excitation
                  spectrum.}

                  (sD 2 ) and the extraction of the density of states
                  for phonons and rotational transitions in sD 2 have
                  led us to a new understanding of the production of
                  ultra-cold neutrons (UCN) in sD 2 . The UCN
                  production rate reaches a maximum at an equivalent
                  neutron temperature of T n =40 K for a neutron flux
                  with Maxwellian energy distribution. The
                  cross-section for UCN production in sD 2 has been
                  determined by using the density of states G 1 ( E )
                  in combination with the incoherent approximation as
                  well as by a direct calibration of our measured

                  measurements of this energy averaged UCN production

                  UCN's build up to a significant density inside a
                  cryogenic container whose walls support the thin
                  films. The UCN's density dependence on the neutron
                  temperature,Tn, was also investigated. It was found
                  that the density reaches a maximum value atTn≏20K. A
                  deuterium film at low temperature (5K) andTn=30 K
                  yields a UCN density $\rho$≏10−9 $\phi$0 where
                  $\phi$0 is the total flux.",

                  to characterize ultracold neutron detection with
                  6Li-doped glass scintillators. Single GS10 or GS20
                  scintillators, with a thickness of 100-200$\mu$m,
                  fulfill the ultracold neutron detection requirements
                  with an acceptable neutron-gamma
                  discrimination. This discrimination is clearly
                  improved with a stack of two scintillators: a
                  6Li-depleted glass bonded to a 6Li-enriched
                  glass. The technique of optical contact bonding is
                  used between the two glasses in order to eliminate
                  the need for optical glue or grease between
                  them. Relative to a 3He Strelkov gas detector, the
                  scintillator's detection efficiency is lower for UCN
                  energies close to the scintillator's Fermi potential
                  (85-100 neV), but becomes larger at higher UCN
                  energies. Coupled to a digital data acquisition
                  system, counting rates up to a few 105 counts/s can
                  be handled. A detector based on such a scintillator
                  stack arrangement was built and has been used in the
                  neutron electric dipole moment experiment at the
                  Paul Scherrer Institute since 2010. Its response for
                  routine runs of the neutron electric dipole moment
                  experiment is presented.",

                  roughness, concentrating near the directions of

                  sources of reflexion losses in guide tubes for
                  ultracold and thermal neutrons, respectively. The

abstract = {Abstract The process to produce an MR image includes
                  nuclear alignment, RF excitation, spatial encoding,
                  and image formation. In simple terms, an magnetic
                  resonance imaging (MRI) system consists of five
                  major components: a magnet, gradient systems, an RF
                  coil system, a receiver, and a computer system. To
                  form an image, it is necessary to perform spatial
                  localization of the MR signals, which is achieved
                  using gradient coils. In modern MRI, gradient coils
                  able to generate high gradient strengths and slew
                  rates are required to produce high imaging speeds
                  and improved image quality. MRI also requires the
                  use of gradient coils that generate magnetic fields,
                  which vary linearly with position over the imaging
                  volume. Gradient coils for MRI must therefore have
                  high current efficiency (defined as the ratio of
                  gradient generated to current drawn), short
                  switching time (i.e., low inductance), gradient
                  linearity over a large volume, low power
                  consumption, and minimal interaction with any other
                  equipment, which would otherwise result in eddy
                  currents. Over the last two decades new methods of
                  gradient coil design have been developed, and a
                  combination of these methods can be a mixture of
                  them trying to avoid discomforts to patients that at
                  the end is the center of all the technological
                  efforts in the art of MRI. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals,

                  gradient and shim coils are needed to produce a
                  spatially varying magnetic field throughout the
                  sample being imaged. Such coils consist of turns of
                  wire wound on the surface of a cylindrical
                  tube. Shim coils in particular, must sometimes be
                  designed to produce complicated magnetic fields to
                  correct for impurities. Streamline patterns for shim
                  coils are much more complicated than those for
                  gradient coils. In this work we present a detailed
                  analysis of streamline methods and their application
                  to shim coil design. A method is presented for

  abstract={This paper continues the development of a new approach for
                  the design of shim and gradient coils, used in
                  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) applications. A
                  cylindrical primary coil of radius a and length 2 L
                  is placed inside a co-axial shield cylinder of
                  radius b . An active shielding strategy is used to
                  create a desired target field at an arbitrarily
                  specified (cylindrical) location within the primary
                  coil, and to annul the field at a certain radius
                  outside the shield. The form of the interior target
                  field may be chosen arbitrarily by the designer,
                  although zonal and tesseral harmonics are typically
                  used in MRI applications. The method presented here
                  designs coil windings on both the primary and
                  shielding cylinders, to produce fields that conform
                  to the specified interior target field and the
                  annulled field exterior to the shield. An additional
                  feature of the method presented here is that the
                  target field inside the primary coil is matched at
                  two different radii, to improve overall
                  accuracy. The method is illustrated by designing
                  several shielded shim coils, for creating higher
                  order tesseral fields located asymmetrically within
                  the coil. The simpler case of pure zonal fields is
                  discussed separately and applied to the design of
                  some higher order shielded coils.}

title = {UCN detection with 6Li-doped glass scintillators},
abstract = {We report the results of test measurements aimed at
                  determining the performance of 6Li-doped glass
                  scintillators for ultra-cold neutron
                  detection. Investigations have mainly focused on the
                  reduction of the gamma-ray sensitivity of the
                  scintillators. The probability of gamma interaction
                  has been considerably lowered using very thin
                  glasses. For signals corresponding to full-energy
                  deposition, a background count rate of 8×10-3 s-1
                  was obtained for a shielded 0.5 cm3 GS10
                  scintillator located near the PF2 turbine at
                  ILL. The neutron-gamma separation has further been
                  improved using a stack with an 6Li-depleted
                  scintillator and an 6Li-enriched one. Neutron
                  captures leading to partial energy deposition
                  (so-called {"}edge events{"}) have strongly been
                  reduced resulting in a clear separation between the
                  neutron and the gamma contributions.},

abstract="We report on the measurement of a Larmor frequency shift
                  proportional to the electric-field strength for
                  199Hg atoms contained in a volume permeated with
                  aligned magnetic and electric fields. This shift
                  arises from the interplay between the inevitable
                  magnetic field gradients and the motional magnetic
                  field. The proportionality to electric-field
                  strength makes it apparently similar to an electric
                  dipole moment (EDM) signal, although unlike an EDM
                  this effect is P- and T-conserving. We have used a
                  neutron magnetic resonance EDM spectrometer,
                  featuring a mercury co-magnetometer and an array of
                  external cesium magnetometers, to measure the shift
                  as a function of the applied magnetic field
                  gradient. Our results are in good agreement with
                  theoretical expectations.",

                  polarized 3He gas by optically pumped cesium

                  a permanent electric dipole moment of ultracold
                  neutrons at the Paul-Scherrer Institute
