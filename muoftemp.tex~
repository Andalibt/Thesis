\chapter{Temperature Dependence of Magnetic Permeability(?)}

\begin{description}
\item{This chapter I think should be very similar to the paper. It
  should be just the extended version of that with more detail (not a
  lot more though! It means I should not include every single data
  that I took!)}
  \item{Motivation: Why are we interested in the temperature
    dependence of mu. The idea of coupling the field of an internal
    coil to the shield and that is because the shield act as a return
    yoke. Then it makes sense to have a stable shield so that the
    internal field does not change. And then explain that one of the
    factors are actually the changes in the temperature that affects
    the magnetic permeability.}
  \item{The main part of this has to be about the measurements,
    explain the technique, show several picture of the setup. Look at
    the long version of the paper on github to remember what we did
    and why and then include the data that made sense.}
  \item{Another relevant part is to make the connection between these
    measurements and the actual changes in the $B$ field and for that
    I have to include the simulations. An explanation of the OPERA
    simulations and FEMM. Explain what each one is and what I did.}
