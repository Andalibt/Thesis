%Finding a non-zero neutron EDM confirms beyond the standard model
%theories that provide extra sources of CP violation.

The work presented in this thesis is part of the R\&D studies towards
the future nEDM experiment at TRIUMF. The existence of a non-zero nEDM
confirms beyond the standard model theories that provide extra sources
of CP violation. Based on Sakharov conditions, these sources are
essential to create the observed Baryon asymmetry in the universe.

The focus of the research in this thesis is on the two aspects of the
nEDM measurement:
\begin{itemize}
\item Magnetic field stability
\item UCN production and storage
\end{itemize}

\section{Overview of Magnetic Field Requirements for the Neutron Electric Dipole
  Moment Measurement }
To measure the nEDM, an ensemble of polarized UCN are placed in
the presence of aligned electric and magnetic fields. The Larmor
precession frequency of the UCN is measured once when the electric and
magnetic fields are parallel, and once when they are
anti-parallel. The frequency shift between these two geometries is
proportional to the nEDM. In this process, the existence of a very
stable and homogeneous magnetic environment is essential. The applied
DC magnetic field should be held constant. To achieve the magnetic
requirements several layers of magnetic shielding are employed
including active and passive shielding. Interal coils are placed
inside the passive shielding to create the DC magnetic field. These
are called the shield-coupled coils. In this case, a change in the
properties of the passive shields, such as magnetic permeability
$\mu$, would affect the magnetic field measured internally. One of the
factors that can cause such changes in $\mu$ is the changes in the
environmental temperature.

\section{Overview of Temperature Dependence of Mangetic Permeability}

In Chapter~\ref{chap:muofT} the result of the studies of the changes
of $\mu$ with temperature were presented and discussed. Two methods
were pursued to study the correlation of the changes in the measured
internal magnetic field with respect to the changes in temperature. In
method one, a witness cylinder with a length of 15.2~cm and a diameter
of 5.2~cm was put inside a coil system that produced a low-frequency
magnetic field. The axial shielding factor was then measured with a
magnetometer as a function of temperature. The temperature was
measured via non-magnetic temperature sensors attached on the witness
cylinder. These measurements were repeated with two different coils to
study the systematic effects. In the second technique, which is more
common, the witness cylinder was used as a core of a transformer. A
primary and a secondary coil were wound on the witness cylinder. Here
the slopes of the minor $B-H$ loops as a function of temperature were
measured.

The overall result of the $B(T)$ measurements are presented in
Tables~\ref{tab:axial} and~\ref{tab:transformer}. These measurements
were conducted in AC fields with frequencies around 1~Hz as opposed to
the DC fields in the actual nEDM experiments. To related these
measurements to $\mu(T)$, finite element simulations were performed to
find the shielding factor of the witness cylinders as a function of
$\mu$. Combining the measurements and the simulations, in the first
method it was found that
0.6\%/K~$<\frac{1}{\mu}\frac{d\mu}{dT}<2.7\%$/K with $H_m$-amplitude
of 0.004~A/m at 1~Hz. In the second method, it was found that
0.0\%/K~$<\frac{1}{\mu}\frac{d\mu}{dT}<2.2\%$/K with a typical
$H_m$-amplitude of 0.1~A/m at 1~Hz.

Considering the overall value of
0.0\%/K~$<\frac{1}{\mu}\frac{d\mu}{dT}<2.7$\%/K and the generic EDM
experiment sensitivity of $\frac{\mu}{B_0}\frac{dB_0}{d\mu}=0.01$, the
temperature dependence of the magnetic field in a typical nEDM
experiment would be $\frac{dB_0}{dT}=0-270$~pT/K. This means, to
achieve the magnetic stability goal of 1~pT in the interal field, the
temperature of the innermost magnetic shield in the nEDM experiment
should be controlled to $<0.004$~K level which puts a challenging
constraint on the future nEDM experiment design.

\section{Overview of UCN Studies at TRIUMF}

The second half of this thesis was focused on the current UCN facility
at TRIUMF. In 2016, the prototype vertical UCN source, previously built
and tested in Japan, was shipped to TRIUMF. The unique feature of this
facility is the production UCN by combining spallation neutrons with a superfluid
helium converter. In Chapter~\ref{chap:UCNattriumf} the faciliy was
described.

In November 2017 the first UCN were produced with the prototype
vertical source at TRIUMF. The experiments include UCN yield, UCN
storage lifetime and UCN rate in the steady-state mode of operation.
Those experiments and their simulations were presented in
Chapter~\ref{chap:UCNresult}. Such experiments are essential for a
better understanding of the UCN cryostat and for the design of the
next generation UCN source.

Around 40,000 UCN were produced at the standard measurement of
1~$\mu$A proton beam current while irradiating the target for
60~s. The maximum number of produced UCN were 325,000 at 10~$\mu$A
proton beam current. In about three weeks of experimental period, the
measured storage lifetime of UCN dropped from 37~s to 27~s. This was
due to the contamination in the source by opening the UCN valve. The
UCN yield also dropped by about 40\%. Other than the source
contamination, different experimental configuration in the second half
of the experimental period caused this drop.

We could successfully produce three times more UCN than ever
before. However, our UCN storage lifetime was only half of the
previously best storage lifetime. It is most likely due to the
contamination in the source after opening the UCN valve, the existence
of the burst disk and the non-optimized UCN valve for the UCN
storage. The result of the simulations proved that the upscattering
rate in the superfluid helium follows
$\tau^{-1}_{\mathrm He} = B T^7$. In addition, the UCN yield and the
UCN storage lifetime simulations matched the experimental values best
when the $B$ values where between 0.008/s and 0.016/s. At higher
temperatures above 1~K, the upscattering in the helium vapour plays a
significant role.

Some measurements with the heater tapes were also performed to find
the amount of heat load on the cryostat when applying the proton
beam. Even though the result of those experiments was not conclusive,
it gave valuable insight for the future experimental plan.


\section{Overall Conclusion and Future Work}
The research presented in this thesis is part of the TUCAN's ongoing
R\&D towards the future nEDM measurement at TRIUMF. Our goal is to
measure the nEDM with the sensitivity level of $10^{-27}$.

The best previous measurement of the nEDM showed that the dominant
systematic uncertainty is due to the magnetic field instability. As a
result, one source of systematic uncertainty, the temperature
dependence of magnetic permeability $\mu$, was studied. The result of
those measurements as well as the relevant simulations showed that, to
fulfill our 1~pT internal magnetic field stability requirement, the
temperature of the innermost magnetic shield for the nEDM experiment
should be controlled to better than 4~mK level while employing the
shield coupled coils to generate the DC field.

The current nEDM experiments suffer from low UCN statistics. The UCN
experiments with our prototype UCN source provide the prerequisites
for building our next-generation UCN source with cooling power and UCN
flux increased by two orders of magnitude~(see
Section~\ref{sec:triumfnedm}). The excellent match of the simulations
and experiments presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:UCNresult} makes us
confident that we can predict the performance of this future source
and experiment very well.
