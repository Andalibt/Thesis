\chapter{Current UCN Facility at TRIUMF}
% Based on simulations, a 40~$\mu$A of current produces a background of
% XXX mSev.

The current vertical UCN cryostat at TRIUMF is the same UCN cryostat
developed and tested at RCNP, Japan between 19xx and
2012(?)~\cite{masuda2002spallation,masuda2012spallation}.  In 2016,
the cryostat was shipped to triumf for further UCN experiments. These
experiments were essential for better understanding of the cryostat
and design of the next generation UCN source.  The vertical source was
modified to fulfill the safety requirements at TRIUMF (find where and
what those are.)  The current location of the vertical source is at
the meson hall experimental area.  A picture of the UCN facitity is
shown below.

The unique feature of the UCN source at TRIUMF is the combination of
spallation neutrons and superfluid helium for UCN production. This
will be discussed in detail in the following sections.

\section{UCN beamline}
TRIUMF's proton beam is provided by a 520 Mev cyclotron. The
120~$\mu$A beam (BL1A) enters the meson hall. This amout of current
creates a lot of heat load on the vertical crystat which makes its
operation impossible. As a result, only part of this beam goes to the
UCN experimental area and it is called BL1U. To be more precise, 1/3 of the beam from BL1A is being 'kicked' away by a kicker magnet.
The structure of the BL1U is shown in Fig.~(\ref{fig:bl1u}).

\section{Stages of UCN Production}
At TRIUMF, UCN is produced in three stages: spallation, moderation and
conversion. Each stage is explained below. Fig.~(?) shows a schematic
of this process.

\subsection{Neutron Spallation Target}

A 1~$\mu$A proton beam hits the Tungsten target. The target is
surrounded by several blocks of lead and graphite to slow down the
fast neutrons. The fast neutrons get reflected from these blocks and
enter the warm D$_2$O moderator~(300 K) and become thermal neutrons with an
energy range of ? and speed range of ?.

\subsection{Neutron Moderation}
Iced heavy water at 20~K is used as the cold moderator. After passing
through the warm D$_2$O, thermal neutrons enter the the cold moderator
and becom fast neutrons. At this stage, the neutrons have an enery
range of ? and the speed range of ?.


\subsection{Neutron Conversion}
The last stage is when the fast neutrons enter the superfluid helium at 0.84 to 0.92~K. UCN is produced as a result of phonon transitions inside the superfluid helium.

\begin{description}
\item{An intro to whatever goes into this chapter}

\item{Start by showing a nice drawing and then talk about each
  componet of the facility:}
  
\item{about proton beam that we get, the magnets and basically how the
  beam reaches the target and how it looks like (Where can I get this
  information? Is it written somewhere?)}
  
\item{A short introduction to say the stages of UCN production and why
  we need the vertical cryostat (Link to the next stage)}
  
\item{It also has to be mention that it is the same vertical sourcse
  as was used at the RCNP and some modifications were made to meet the
  requirements at triumf. (Where can I find what modifications were
  made?) Agian this has to be just as a link to the next chapter(maybe?)}
  
\item{The target and shielding (with pictures?), only a few
  paragraphs}
  
\item{Moderation: D2O system (I can use Ryohei's thesis I guess)}
  
\item{conversion. There is a whole chapter dedicated to the UCN
  cryogenics. I have to go through details (not too much) of how the
  cryostat works. I can borrow some infromation from Ryohei's
  thesis. I am not sure how much of it is related to the next
  chapter.}
 

\item{Data acquisition system, epics and plc, I guess there are useful
  informaion in Sean Vanbergen's report that I can use for this
  section}
  
\item{what else?}
