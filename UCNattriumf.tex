\chapter{Current UCN Facility at TRIUMF\label{chap:UCNattriumf}}

% Based on simulations, a 40~$\mu$A of current produces a background of
% XXX mSev.

The current vertical UCN cryostat at TRIUMF is the same UCN cryostat
developed and tested at RCNP,
Japan~\cite{masuda2002spallation,masuda2012spallation}.  In 2016, the
cryostat was shipped to triumf and in 2017 it was installed at a
dedicated a dedicated spallation neutron source for further UCN
experiments. The main purpose of such experiments were for better
understanding of the vertical UCN source and the design of the next
generation UCN source. The 520~MeV cyclotron at TRIUMF provides up to
40~$\mu$A of proton beam that can be diverted onto a tungsten
spallation target. The vertical UCN source is placed above the target
and is surrounded by graphite blocks serving as neutron reflectors.


The vertical source was modified to fulfill the Canadian safety
requirements at TRIUMF. Those include installing pressure relief
valves on the cryostat and the UCN guides and additional radiation
shielding requiring much longer UCN guides compared to RCNP. The
current location of the vertical source is at the meson hall
experimental area. A map of TRIUMF is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sitemap}.

The unique feature of the UCN source at TRIUMF is the combination of
spallation neutrons and superfluid helium for UCN production. Diffenet
elements of the UCN facility at TRIUMF are presented below.

\section{UCN Beam Line}
TRIUMF produces negatively charged hydrogen ions from an ion
source. These ions are then accelerated in the 520~Mev cyclotron in an
outward spiral trajectory. A thin graphite stripper foil removes the
electrons from the hydrogen ion while protons can pass through. The
proton, because it is a positively charged particle, is deflected in
the outward direction due to the magnetic field and is directed to a
proton beam line. TRIUMF has four independent extraction probes with
various sizes of foils to provide protons simultaneously to up to four
beam lines.

The 120~$\mu$A beam (BL1A) enters the Meson Hall where the UCN
facility is located. The vertical UCN source is designed for a
maximum of 40~$\mu$A beam on target. As a result, only one third of
the beam can go to the UCN experimental area and the rest is shared
with different experimental facilities.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{bl1u.png}
  \caption{UCN beam structure. The top graph shows the 120~$\mu$A BL1A
    in 1~ms period of beam followed by a 50-100~$\mu$s of no
    beam. The middle graph shows the same beamline when the kicker
    magnet is on. The bottom graph shows the 1/3 of the beam that goes
    to the UCN area.}
  \label{fig:bl1u}
\end{figure}

The microstructure of BL1A is in pulses with approximately 1~ms
periods of beam followed by a 50-100~$\mu$s periods of no beam.  This
is shown in Fig.~(\ref{fig:bl1u})~\cite{Nick_thesis}. A kicker magnet
and the septum magnet kick away 1/3 of the beam from BL1A to BL1U and
transport it to a conventional dipole (bender) magnet~(See
Fig.~\ref{fig:magnets}).

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{magnets.png}
  \caption{The kicker, septum and dipole (bender) magnets define the
    front two sections of BL1U.}
  \label{fig:magnets}
\end{figure}

After the bender magnet, the beam then passes through a cored
shielding block and reaches the two quadrupole magnets providing the
final focus of the beam onto a 12 cm thick tungsten spallation target.
The target is located inside a hermetically-sealed target crypt, which
also envelops the beamline exit window that defines the end of BL1U.
Upstream of the beamline window, there is a collimator to reduce the
halo from the proton beam, as well as to help reduce the amount of
neutrons and photons streaming back into the beamline from the target
region (the collimator also increases the impedance for the passage of
gas arising from any target or window failure, to allow time for the
cyclotron fast valves to close). This last part of the beamline also
contains a variety of beam position and current monitors. The
spallation target and UCN source, located downstream of the
beamline-exit window, are enclosed in a large shielding
pyramid~Fig~\ref{fig:pyramid}.
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{pyramid.png}
  \caption{Two quadrupole magnets which focus the proton beam onto a
    12~cm thick tungsten spallation target, located inside a

    pyramid, which encases both the spallation target and the UCN
    source, and is designed to meet the dose rate requirements
    specified by the TRIUMF Safety Group.}
  \label{fig:pyramid}
\end{figure}
\section{Tungsten Spallation Target}
The spallation target is located at the downstream end of BL1U. The
UCN spallation target comprises a series of rectangular blocks, adding
up to roughly one stopping length (11 cm) of tungsten, with a
cross-section of $\sim6 \times 8$~cm$^2$~(see
Fig.~\ref{fig:target}). This geometry is very similar to (and
motivated by) the neutron spallation target design used at KEK (KENS
facility)~\cite{kawai2001fabrication}. The target requires a support
and cooling system, and is designed to allow for remote-handling and
ease of servicing. The target-cooling and remote-handling systems are
designed for an instantaneous proton current of 40~$\mu$A (10~$\mu$A
time-averaged).
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{target.png}
  \caption{(a) Tungsten Target Blocks from the spallation target at
    KEK. The target blocks are plated with tantalum. (b) Present
    design for the tungsten spallation target at the TRIUMF UCN
    facility. The target blocks have a cross-section of
    $5.7 \times 7.8$~cm$^2$ , and thicknesses of 2.0, 2.0, 3.0, and
    5.0~cm, respectively.}
  \label{fig:target}
\end{figure}
The target is being water-cooled. A coating of tantalum prevents
corrosion by the water cooling system. An extraction system allows to
exchange the target when necessary.

\section{Stages of UCN Production In The Source}
At TRIUMF, UCN is produced in three stages: Spallation, moderation and
conversion. Fig.~(\ref{fig:ucn_production_stages}) shows a schematic of
this process.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{ucn_production_stages.png}
  \caption{blah}
  \label{fig:ucn_production_stages}
\end{figure}
%\subsection{Neutron Spallation Target}

The neutrons are produced through the spallation process by hitting a
Tungsten target by the proton beam. Spallation is refered to a nuclear
reaction where high energy particles interact with atomic
nucleus. This process creates many high energy neutrons and background
radiation.  The target is surrounded by several blocks of lead and
graphite. These fast neutrons
are reflected and moderated down and enter the warm D$_2$O moderator at room temperature~(300 K) and become thermal
neutrons with an energy of 0.025~eV and the speed of 2.2~km/s.

%\subsection{Neutron Moderation}
Iced heavy water at 20~K is used as a cold moderator. After passing
through the warm D$_2$O, thermal neutrons enter the the cold moderator
and become cold neutrons. These neutrons have the speed of several
hundreds of meter per second.

%\subsection{Neutron Conversion}
The last stage is when the slow neutrons enter the isotopically pure superfluid helium
at 0.84 to 0.92~K. UCN is produced as a result of phonon transitions
inside the superfluid helium as discussed in section~\ref{sec:ucn_with_heII}.


\section{D$_2$O Solidification}
The D$_2$O vessel has a capacity of 100~L. At first, 14~L of liquid
D$_2$O gets injected to the vessel. This is followed by adding 11~L of
D$_2$O to the vessel over 8 times.  After filling up the vessel,
Gifford McMahon refrigerators solidify the heavy water and further
cool it down to 10~K. The process of icing the heavy water takes about
6 days and cooling it down takes another XXX days.

\section{Data Acquisition System\ref{sec:DAQ}}
Here talk about the EPICS and PLC and put pictures. I can also use
stuff from student's reports.

\section{UCN Detectors\label{sec:detectors}}
Talk about how each detector works.
\subsection{$^6$Li Detector\label{sec:Li6detector}}
The main detector used during the UCN measurements~(See
Chapter~\ref{chap:UCNresult}) is a $^6\mathrm{Li}$ glass based scintillator
detector designed and built at the University of Winnipeg for the
TUCAN nEDM experiment at
TRIUMF~\cite{jamieson2017characterization}. Since $^6\mathrm{Li}$ has a high
neutron capture cross-section~(order of $10^5$ bn) at UCN energies,
the scintillator glass is doped with it. The charged particles in the
reaction
\begin{equation}
^6Li + n \rightarrow \alpha (2.05~\mathrm{MeV}) + t (2.73~\mathrm{MeV})
\end{equation}
are detected. To reduce the effect of $\alpha$ or triton escaping the
glass, a layer of 60~$\mu$m thick depleted $^6\mathrm{Li}$ glass (GS30), on top
of a layer of 120~$\mu$m thick dopped $^6\mathrm{Li}$ (GS20) were optically
bonded. This design allows the resultant particles to deposit all of
their energy within the scintillating
glass. Table~\ref{tab:scintillator} shows the content and density of
those $^6\mathrm{Li}$ scintillators.

\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \label{tab:scintillator}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    Scintillator & GS20~($^6\mathrm{Li}$ Enriched) & GS30~( $^6\mathrm{Li}$ depleted) \\
    \hline
    Total Li content (\%) & 6.6 & 6.6 \\
    \hline
    $^6\mathrm{Li}$ fraction (\%) & 95 & 0.01 \\
    \hline
    $^6\mathrm{Li}$ desity~(cm$^{-3}$) & $1.716 \times 10^{22}$ & $1.806 \times 10^{18}$ \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Properties of the glass scintillators}
\end{table}


Making the scintillating Li glass as thin as possible reduces the
sensitivity to $\gamma$-ray scintillating backgrounds and and thermal
neutron captures. The mean range of the $\alpha$ is 5.3~$\mu$m and the
mean range of the triton is 34.7~$\mu$m. This means that if the
thickness of the scintillator is less than 50~$\mu$m, the resultant
particles escape before stopping which gives rise to an efficiency
loss.  In order to handle high UCN rates of up to \~1~MHz, the
$^6\mathrm{Li}$ detector face is segmented into 9 tiles~(See
Fig.~\ref{fig:Li6detector}). The scintillation light is then guided
through ultra-violet transmitting acrylic light-guide to its
corresponding Photomultiplier Tube~(PMT) outside the vaccum region of
the detector.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Li6detector.png}
  \caption{3D drawing of the $^6$Li detector and its enclosure. The
    enclosure is made of Al, and the rim of the adapter flange which
    UCN can hit is ccoated with 1~$\mu$m Ni by thermal evaporation. }
  \label{fig:Li6detector}
\end{figure}

The data acquisition with this detector includes a CAEN V1720
digitizer which has a Pulse-Shape Discrimination~(PSD) firmware that
triggers on pulses below a certain threshold for each channel. Every
4~ns the digitizer samples the waveform which is then digitized to a
voltage on a 2~V scale into an ADC value between 0 and 4096. Each
channel of the digitizer sends a trigger whenever the number of counts
in the ADC goes below a certain baseline~(pedestal) value. The PSD
calculates the sum of the signal below the baseline for two time
windows: $t_s = 40$~ns (short gate) and $t_L = 200$~ns~(long
gate). The short gate is chosen in a way to contain all of the charge
for the $\gamma$-ray interactions in the light-guide. The ADC sum for
during the long gate below the baseline is calle $Q_L$~(read charge
long) and for during the short gate below the baseline is called
$Q_S$. Charge long has the total charge deposti for the neutron
capture events. The PSD value is defined as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:psd}
  \mathrm{PSD} = \frac{\left( Q_L - Q_S\right)}{Q_L}
\end{equation}  
which is the amount of charge in the tail of an event.

Jamieson {\it{et al.}} showed that the absolute efficiency of this
detector is $89.7^{+1.3}_{-1.9}$~\% with a background contamination of
$0.3 \pm 0.1$~\%~\cite{jamieson2017characterization}. The detector is
stable at the 0.06~\% level or better, and that the variation in the
efficiency between the detector tiles is less than 5~\%.
